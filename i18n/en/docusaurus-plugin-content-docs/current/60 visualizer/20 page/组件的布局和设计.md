# Layout design of components

DATAFOR's page layout is "free layout", users can flexibly add and place components on the page, set the level of components, and make personalized analysis reports.

## Add and remove components

**Add Component**: In the component panel on the right side of the page designer, click to select the component, click and drag the mouse in the canvas area, and a component without data binding is added to the canvas.

**Delete a single component**: Click the selected component on the canvas, press the "Delete" key, or click the "Delete" button on the toolbar.

**Delete Multiple Components**: Ctrl key + mouse click on the component or drag the mouse on the canvas to select multiple components, press the "Delete" key, or click the "Delete" button on the toolbar.

## Component resizing

Two ways:

- When the mouse hovers over the thick line at the border of the component, the mouse state changes to a double-headed arrow, and you can drag the mouse to adjust the size of the component.
- Directly enter the width and height values of the component in the width and height input boxes on the toolbar. This works great when resizing multiple components at the same time.

## Movement of components

Click to select the component to be moved, move the mouse to the component area, click and hold the mouse, the mouse arrow will become a moving icon, drag the mouse at this time, and the component will move along with the mouse icon.

2. Click the Align drop-down button or Distribute down button on the toolbar

## Level adjustment of components

Under free layout, all components have a hierarchical relationship. Every time a component is added, it will be placed at the top by default.

Select one or more components, select the layer adjustment drop-down button on the toolbar, and select the appropriate layer adjustment method: move up one layer, put it on the top, move down one layer, and put it on the bottom.

## Copy of components

Support copy/cut, paste a single component or multiple components, support copy/cut and paste across pages.

- Select one or more components, and use the copy, cut, and paste buttons on the toolbar to perform copy, cut, and paste operations.
- Select one or more groups, and use the shortcut keys Ctrl+C, Ctrl+X, Ctrl+V to perform copy, cut, and paste operations

## Switching of component type

During the design process, the component type can be switched, and the switched component uses the data model of the original component.
