# Pivot table

A Pivot Table is an interactive table that can perform certain calculations, such as sums and counts. The calculations and data are performed relative to the arrangement in the PivotTable. Pivot tables can dynamically change the row and column cross-dimensions to summarize and analyze data from different angles.

## Applicable scene
