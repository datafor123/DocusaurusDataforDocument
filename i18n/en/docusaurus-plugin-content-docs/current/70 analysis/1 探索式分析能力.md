## Cross-Filtering and Cross-Highlighting

Cross-filtering and cross-highlighting occur when selecting a data point in one visual automatically updates other visuals to reflect related data. This allows you to view data across multiple dimensions simultaneously, recognizing relationships between different data points for a more comprehensive understanding.
